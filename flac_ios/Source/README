Xcode project to create a fat binary libFLAC framework for use in iOS apps. 

The source for libFLAC can be found here: 

http://flac.sourceforge.net/

If you are curious how to create your own frameworks for iOS apps check here: 

https://github.com/jverkoey/iOS-Framework

To build:
1. install libogg: http://xiph.org/downloads/
2. Select the Framework target
3. Build for Debug or Release
4. Find FLACiOS.framework in ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/FLACiOS-<some_hash>/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/
5. Include the folder as a Framework in your other Xcode iOS projects

*Note: a lot of people have had trouble building due to missing the ogg headers. 
You can checkout the no-ogg branch to build without ogg support if you don't need it in your project.
