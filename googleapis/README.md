# Google Protocol Buffer and API definitions

This directory contains **proto** files that describe Google APIs that are used in these samples and a **podspec** that allows supporting code to be built with Cocoapods.

Proto files are copied from the definitive set in [the GoogleAPIs repository](http://github.com/googleapis/googleapis).

To learn more about protocol buffers and the proto file format, see [Google's Protocol Buffer documentation](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/).
